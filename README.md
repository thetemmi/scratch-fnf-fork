## ⚠️ Fork notice

The priginal is from cabalex, supports only LEGACY(or psych engine) fnf json

Scratch on!

A song converter for [my Scratch FNF clone](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1210906975/). The converter converts song JSON files made in the [Friday Night Funkin'](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin) song editor (go into a song and press 7) to TXT files that can be imported into Scratch lists (right click on the list > import...).

Coded with [pretty bad] HTML and JS.
